        <h3>Waterfowl Hunting</h3>
        We hunt the sandbars and Islands in the Platte River from floating blinds and portable blinds providing a
        one-of-a kind hunt in a beautiful setting. Our adjacent wetlands provide a heated pit blind complete with
        hot plates for cooking, electricity, and comfortable chairs with an awesome view. We hunt exclusively over
        water, decoying flocks of ducks and geese close for a mixed bag opportunity both in the river and flooded
        wetlands. Ice-out systems assure an open water hunt, even during the harshest, coldest conditions. Our
        wetlands are located on the same property as the lodge. Professional calling, top notch retrievers, state of
        the art decoys, and large concentrations of Mallards and Canada Geese have made lifetime of memories for
        generations of hunters at Lost Island.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Hunt Packages 2021-22</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="line-item"> 4 hunters - $1,200 per seat - includes - 3 day guided hunt, and 4 nights lodging.
            </li>
            <li class="line-item">Corporate Groups are fully customizable and start at $300 per seat depending upon
                group size, length
                of stay, lodging, food, equipment needed, etc.</li>
            <li class="line-item"> From 1 to a small group hunters for the day - $200-$400 per day depending upon type
                of hunt, gear provided etc.
            </li>
            <li class="line-item">We frequently take people hunting every fall who may be alone or with a buddy that we
                can add to a
                smaller group for a day or two, call to inquire on availability.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>A typical day – what to expect</h3>
        We start at the lodge with hot coffee, decide which locations will give us the
        best opportunity for the conditions that day, then head for the river or wetlands pre-dawn, set decoys and be
        ready. If we haven’t bagged our limits, we’ll normally pick up the decoys for the day around 2-3 pm, as we want
        to be off the river and wetlands and let birds return to the area to roost late afternoon and evening.
        <br><br>
        <h3>What to bring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="line-item">Warm, waterproof, camouflage, clothes and layers. Hats, gloves, neck gaiters, hip
                boots or chest
                waders. Bring extras.</li>

        <h3>Dogs and Calling</h3>
        Well trained dogs are welcome to accompany you at Lost Island. If your dog is
        misbehaving, they’ll need to leave the blind.Proficient,
        experienced callers are welcome to help their guide call ducks and geese most days, however we insist, novice
        callers only help while visiting neighboring duck clubs…
        <br><br>

        blind, and evening meals are your responsibility with several options available. We have a fully appointed
